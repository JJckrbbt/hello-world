This is my first repository on GitHub!

I am a podcaster and event organizer focused on positive change related to second amendment issues in New Jersey.  To that end, I host the Bear Arms Show and founded the New Jersey Second Amendment and Firearms Education Conference.  Wordpress sites have met my needs so far, but I am interested in expanding my knowledge of web development.  So here I am.
